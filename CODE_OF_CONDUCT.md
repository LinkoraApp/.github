# Linkora Code of Conduct

## The Basics

Look, this isn't complicated. We're all here because we care about building something useful. That means treating each other like actual people, with brains, feelings, and common sense. If you need a 50-page document to tell you how to be decent, this isn't the place for you.

## What Gets You Banned

Some things have zero tolerance. No warnings, no second chances, no appeals:

* **Harassment of any kind.** This includes but isn't limited to: targeted insults, unwanted sexual attention, discriminatory comments, or anything that makes someone feel unsafe or unwelcome.
* **Doxxing.** Sharing someone's private information without consent is an instant permanent ban. No exceptions.
* **Destructive behavior.** Threats, stalking, impersonation, sustained disruption, or basically anything that crosses the line from "passionate contributor" to "someone who clearly doesn't know how to function in a shared space".

This should already give you an idea on how to act. If you ignored it, that's on you.

## Communication Standards

Technical disagreements are fine and often necessary. Different perspectives make the project better. But keep it professional and constructive. No slurs, no personal attacks, no comments designed to hurt someone's feelings. Debate the idea, not the person.

As the project grows, people will come and go. Nobody expects you to be active 24/7. We all have jobs, lives, and other projects. But when you are here, communicate with respect.

## Localization Contributors

I genuinely appreciate the help in making Linkora accessible to everyone. However, translations are public-facing and represent the project.

**If you submit offensive content, slurs, or deliberately garbage translations, you will be permanently banned.** This falls under the Zero Tolerance policy. Don't insert jokes, personal messages, or anything inappropriate. If you're not sure about a translation, don't translate it. Just skip it.

## Scope

This applies **strictly** to the Linkora organization and its repositories on GitHub. That is it.

I do not police the internet. I do not moderate social media, Discord servers, or private chats. If you have a problem with someone outside of the Linkora organization, keep it outside of the organization.

Do not bring external drama into issues, pull requests, or discussions. If it didn't happen on a Linkora repository, it is not my problem to solve.

## Maintainer Authority and Accountability

Maintainers can remove, edit, or reject anything within the repo: comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, contributions. We're building software, not running a democracy. Maintainers make the final call to keep the project moving.

**But maintainers aren't special.** Being a maintainer doesn't make you superior or exempt from these rules within the repo. You follow the code of conduct just like everyone else, and if you violate it here, you get banned just like anyone else. As I am currently the sole maintainer, this applies to me too.

## Everyone Means Everyone

This applies to everybody interacting with the Linkora repositories in any capacity. Contributors, issue reporters, maintainers, and one-time participants. Everyone. Nobody gets special treatment. Nobody gets to be toxic just because they wrote a lot of code or maintain a component.

## Why Zero Tolerance?

We build open-source stuff because it has an impact that everyone can be part of, something meaningful. We don't have the energy or patience to deal with bad actors, manage drama, or give people multiple chances to figure out how to be decent.

## Reporting

If someone violates this code of conduct **on this organization's repositories**, report it to **sakethh@proton.me**.

**Please use the subject line: "Linkora CoC Violation"**

I'll review the report, look into what happened, and reply with what's being done about it once I've seen the issue.

## For Contributions

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the respective repositories for guidelines on how to actually contribute code, report issues, and participate in development. This document is about behavior; that one is about the work itself.

---

**Bottom line:** Act like a reasonable human being with basic decency while you are in this organization's repos. If you can't do that, this isn't the community for you.
